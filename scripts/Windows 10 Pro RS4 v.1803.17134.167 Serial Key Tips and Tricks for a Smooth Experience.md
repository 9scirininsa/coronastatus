However, you may not have a genuine product key that you can use on a test machine, or you may not want to activate it with your licensed product key that you use on a real machine.

Using a generic key can be helpful if you want to evaluate or test Windows 10 Pro RS4 v.1803.17134.167 for a limited time, or if you plan to activate it later when you have a digital license or a genuine product key available.

## What is a Generic Key for Windows 10?
 
A generic key for Windows 10 is a default key that is provided by Microsoft for each edition of Windows 10. It is not specific to any device or user, and it can be used by anyone to install or upgrade to a specific Windows 10 edition.
 
A generic key for Windows 10 will not activate the OS, meaning that you will not be able to use some features and services that require activation, such as personalization, Windows Update, Microsoft Store, and more.

A generic key for Windows 10 is only valid for a certain period of time, usually 30 days, after which you will need to activate Windows 10 with a digital license or a genuine product key.
