SMASH BOY Ver.KZ is a single-player mouse-based action game that was released on Steam in August 2018. The game is developed by excessm, a Japanese indie studio known for creating games with sexual content and anime aesthetics. In SMASH BOY Ver.KZ, you play as a boy who has to fight his way through an army of evil ladies who want to capture him for their own purposes. You can customize your own unique attack combinations and equip skills to suit your playing style. The game features simple but fast paced combat, colorful graphics, and a variety of enemies and stages.
 
The game is a more affordable version of the original SMASH BOY that removes certain elements to fit an all-ages audience. However, you can still enjoy the action and humor of the game without the explicit content. The game also offers a custom battle mode where you can freely edit stages and choose the enemies you want to fight. If you are looking for a fun and easy-to-play action game with anime style, you might want to check out SMASH BOY Ver.KZ on Steam.
