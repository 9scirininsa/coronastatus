FeatureCAM is a CAM software that allows you to create and edit toolpaths for various types of CNC machines, such as milling, turning, wire EDM, and multi-tasking. FeatureCAM comes with a library of post processors for different machine models and controllers, but you can also download and install additional post processors from the Autodesk website or other sources.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install a FeatureCAM post processor in three easy steps.
 
## Step 1: Find the Post Processor You Need
 
The first step is to find the post processor that matches your machine type and controller. You can browse the available post processors on the Autodesk website by following this link: [https://www.autodesk.com/cam-post-processors](https://www.autodesk.com/cam-post-processors). You can filter the post processors by product, machine type, controller, vendor, and language. You can also search for a specific post processor by entering its name or keyword in the search box.
 
If you cannot find the post processor you need on the Autodesk website, you can also check other sources, such as the FeatureCAM user forum, the machine manufacturer's website, or third-party vendors. However, you should always verify the quality and compatibility of the post processor before downloading it.

## Step 2: Download the Post Processor File
 
The second step is to download the post processor file to your computer. The post processor file usually has a .ppf extension and contains the code and settings for the post processor. You can download the post processor file by clicking on its name or the download button on the Autodesk website or other sources.
 
Once you have downloaded the post processor file, you should save it in a folder that is accessible by FeatureCAM. The default folder for FeatureCAM post processors is C:\Program Files\Autodesk\FeatureCAM 2023\Posts. However, you can also create a custom folder for your post processors and add it to FeatureCAM's search path. To do this, go to File > Options > Posting and click on Add Path. Then browse to your custom folder and click OK.
 
## Step 3: Load the Post Processor into FeatureCAM
 
The third step is to load the post processor into FeatureCAM and apply it to your toolpaths. There are three methods to load a new post processor in FeatureCAM[^1^].
 
- Method 1: Selecting File > Options. Select Posting, followed by the machine type (Milling, TurnMill, or Wire). Click âBrowseâ and select the required post processor.
- Method 2: Click on the post displayed in the status bar as shown in the example below, where the same process is used to locate and choose a new post processor.
- Method 3: Right-click on any toolpath in your project tree and select Post Processor > Change Post Processor. Then browse to your desired post processor and click OK.

After loading the post processor, you can check its settings and parameters by clicking on Edit Post Processor in any of the methods above. You can also preview and edit the output code by clicking on Simulate > NC Code or NC Code Editor.
 
That's it! You have successfully downloaded and installed a FeatureCAM post processor. Now you can generate machine-specific code for your toolpaths and run them on your CNC machine.
