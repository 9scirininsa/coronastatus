## The Xpose Full Movie Review: A Musical Thriller with a Retro Flair
  
The Xpose is a film that pays homage to the golden era of Hindi cinema, the 1960s, when glamour, music and mystery ruled the screen. The film is inspired by real-life incidents and personalities from that period, such as Rajkumar, Shammi Kapoor, Zeenat Aman and Helen. The film also features some catchy songs composed by Himesh Reshammiya himself, who plays the lead role of Ravi Kumar, a former cop turned superstar singer.
  
The film begins with the murder of Zara Fernandes (Sonali Raut), a rising starlet who has a bitter rivalry with Chandni (Zoya Afroz), another aspiring actress. Both of them are vying for the attention of Ravi Kumar, who is also involved with another singer, Kenny Damania (Yo Yo Honey Singh). The police suspect Chandni of killing Zara, but Ravi believes in her innocence and decides to investigate the case himself. He is aided by Alec D'Costa (Irrfan Khan), a journalist who has a keen interest in the case. As Ravi digs deeper into the murky world of showbiz, he uncovers many secrets and lies that could put his life in danger.
  
The Xpose is a film that tries to recreate the charm and thrill of the 1960s cinema, but falls short of its potential. The film has a decent plot and some interesting twists, but suffers from poor execution and direction. The film also lacks coherence and consistency in its tone and style. The film switches between comedy, drama and suspense without any smooth transition or logic. The film also relies heavily on clichÃ©s and stereotypes to portray the characters and situations.
  
The film's biggest drawback is its lead actor, Himesh Reshammiya, who fails to impress as Ravi Kumar. He looks uncomfortable and unnatural in his lean avatar and his expressions are wooden and monotonous. He also delivers some cheesy dialogues with a straight face that are meant to be witty and cool, but end up being laughable and cringeworthy. His chemistry with his co-stars is also lacking and his singing is not as appealing as his previous albums.
  
The film's saving grace is its supporting cast, especially Yo Yo Honey Singh, who plays the negative role of Kenny Damania with flair and confidence. He also sings some of the best songs of the film, such as Ice Cream Khaungi and Dard Dilo Ke. Irrfan Khan also adds some credibility and charisma to his role of Alec D'Costa, who has a hidden agenda behind his journalism. Zoya Afroz and Sonali Raut are decent as Chandni and Zara respectively, but do not have much scope to showcase their acting skills.
  
The film's music is another highlight of the film, as it captures the essence and mood of the 1960s era. The songs are catchy and melodious, and suit the situations well. The songs are also well picturised and choreographed, with some references to classic songs and scenes from that period. The film's production design is also commendable, as it recreates the sets and costumes of the 1960s with authenticity and detail.
  
The Xpose is a film that could have been a great tribute to the 1960s cinema, but ends up being a mediocre musical thriller that fails to engage or entertain. The film has some moments of fun and intrigue, but they are overshadowed by its flaws and shortcomings. The film is only recommended for those who are fans of Himesh Reshammiya or Yo Yo Honey Singh, or those who have a nostalgia for the 1960s cinema.
