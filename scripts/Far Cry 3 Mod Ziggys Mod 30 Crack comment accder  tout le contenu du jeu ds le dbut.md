You will also have realistic icons for weapons and skills, high-resolution icons for the map and compass, and high-resolution reticles for all sights.
- Immersive audio: You will hear less annoying sounds such as grenade switch tick, crouch/stand sound, humming on menus, XP gain sound, interaction prompt sound, and various other sounds.
