If you are looking for a way to improve the quality of your vocal recordings, you might want to consider using a noise reduction plugin. Noise reduction plugins can help you eliminate unwanted background noise, such as room reverb, air conditioning, traffic, or fans, that can ruin your vocal performance. One of the best noise reduction plugins on the market is CEDAR Noise Reduction Plugin, developed by C-Suite Audio in collaboration with CEDAR Audio, a leading company in audio restoration and forensic audio systems.
 
CEDAR Noise Reduction Plugin is designed specifically for vocal recordings, and it uses world-leading noise suppression technology that adapts to your signal in real time. Unlike other noise reduction plugins that require you to set a noise profile or threshold, CEDAR Noise Reduction Plugin has only two controls: Amount and Output. The Amount control lets you adjust how much noise reduction you want to apply, and the Output control lets you adjust the overall level of your processed signal. You can use CEDAR Noise Reduction Plugin as an insert effect on your vocal track, or as a send effect on a bus.
